# About

I am creating this WPF application in Visual Studio 2022 to assist my wife in meal planning and preparation. This app will provide a convenient way to create, store, and display recipe names along with their ingredients and proportions. While it will not contain the instructions for each recipe, it will provide a convenient place for my wife to quickly access the ingredients lists for various recipes without relying on her memory or scattered notes.

By clicking the "create recipe" button on the top of the home screen, a user is able to input data which will create a new recipe, along with its ingredients and their proportions. The recipe and its information are saved in a database. Once saved, the recipe name will appear in a list on the left side of the home page. The application will work by having a list of recipes on the left side of the main page. Upon selecting a recipe and clicking a button, the list of ingredients will appear along with their proportions on the right side of the main page.
